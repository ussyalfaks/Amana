**Amana** is a decentralized escrow protocol designed to secure agricultural trade across different regions. By leveraging **Soroban Smart Contracts**, Amana eliminates the "Trust Gap" between buyers and sellers, ensuring fair trade even when parties are hundreds of miles apart.

## 🚀 The Mission
To provide a programmable safety net for regional commodity trading. Amana ensures that the risk of "sending first" is eliminated, replaced by a secure, neutral vault that only releases funds when delivery is verified.

## 🛠 Features
- **Smart Escrow:** Secure funds holding using USDC/Stablecoins on the Stellar network.
- **Dynamic Loss Sharing:** Negotiable risk-sharing ratios (e.g., 50/50, 70/30) hardcoded into every trade to handle transit accidents or theft.
- **Proof-of-Delivery (PoD):** A mandatory video-based verification protocol involving the buyer and the driver to confirm the state of goods.
- **Volatility Protection:** Utilizes Stellar Path Payments to allow users to pay in local currency (NGN) while locking the value in USDC to protect against inflation.
- **Automated Settlement:** A flat 1% platform fee is automatically deducted upon successful trade completion.

## 🏗 Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Smart Contracts:** [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) (Rust)
- **Blockchain:** [Stellar Network](https://www.stellar.org/)
- **Wallet Connection:** [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) / [Albedo](https://albedo.link/)
- **Storage:** IPFS (via Pinata) for decentralized storage of video evidence.
- **Database:** Supabase (Off-chain metadata, driver logs, and user profiles).

## 🔄 How It Works (The Amana Flow)

1. **Initiate:** The Seller lists products. The Buyer initiates a trade, depositing funds that are converted to USDC via a Stellar Path Payment.
2. **Lock:** The Smart Contract locks the funds and stores the agreed-upon `Loss_Ratio`.
3. **Dispatch:** The Seller provides the driver's name, phone number, and vehicle manifest.
4. **Verification:** - **Success:** Buyer receives goods and uploads a confirmation video. Funds release to Seller.
   - **Dispute:** Buyer uploads a video of loss/damage with driver affirmation. A mediator reviews the evidence.
5. **Settlement:** Based on the outcome, funds are distributed (either 100% to one party or split via the `Loss_Ratio`).

### Phase 1: The Vault (MVP)
- [ ] Develop core Soroban contract logic (`deposit`, `release`, `refund`).
- [ ] Implement basic Next.js UI for trade creation.

### Phase 2: The Agreement Engine
- [ ] Integrate `Loss_Ratio` variables into the smart contract.
- [ ] Build the "Mediator" dashboard for dispute resolution.

### Phase 3: Evidence & Logistics
- [ ] IPFS integration for video evidence uploads.
- [ ] Driver manifest logging and tracking interface.

### Phase 4: Mainnet & Scale
- [ ] Public pilot program with regional agricultural cooperatives.
- [ ] Implementation of a "Trust Score" reputation system.
